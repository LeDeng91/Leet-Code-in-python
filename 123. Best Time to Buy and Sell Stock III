Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        buy_one = float('inf')
        sell_one = 0
        buy_two = float('inf')
        sell_two = 0
        
        for p in prices:
            
            buy_one = min(p, buy_one)
            sell_one = max(sell_one, p-buy_one)
            buy_two = min(buy_two, p-sell_one)
            sell_two = max(sell_two, p-buy_two)
            
        return sell_two
        
        
------------------------------------------------------------- #explanation --------------------------------------------------------------------------
buy_one is the global minimum cost;
sell_one is the maximum profit if we only sell once
buy_two is the maximum left money after we use the profit from 1.transaction
sell_two is the maximum profit we earn after sell twice.
