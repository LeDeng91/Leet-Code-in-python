Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

        explanation:
        let's take instance 1 ['(','[','}'] and instance 2 ['{','[',']','}'] as examples:
        instance 1:
        1: the 1st element '(' is in the map, so the ')' will be added in the stack. ------------> status check: stack=(')')
        2: the 2nd element '[' is in the map, so the ']' will be added in the stack. ------------> status check: stack=(')',']')
        3: the 3rd element '}' is not in the map, so move to the else-statement: 
           top_element = ']', and '}' not equals ']', so the output is FALSE
           
        instance 2:
        1: the 1st element '{' is in the map, so the '}' will be added in the stack. ------------> status check: stack=('}')
        2: the 2nd element '[' is in the map, so the ']' will be added in the stack. ------------> status check: stack=('}',']')
        3. the 3rd element ']' is not in the map, so move to else-statement:
           top_element in stack is ] and matches the 3rd element: continue. ----------------------> status check: stack=('}') (the "]" is out because of pop command)
        4. the 4th element '}' is not in the map, so move to slese-statement:
           top_element in stack is } and matches the 4th element: continue. ----------------------> status check: stack=() (the "}" is out because of pop command)
           The length will be used as a FLAG to determine the output. If it becomes 0, that means the stack is now emptyed successfully and all the brackets are closed in the right order.
           the final output is True
